          4 stars I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the
          apples very nicely. -- Reviewed on Sep. 22, 2010 by MMASON.

          Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of
          it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of
          it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds
          detracted from the overall flavor. -- Reviewed on Sep. 1, 2010 by

          Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before
          baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for
          the holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.
